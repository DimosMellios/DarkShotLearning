--- Not all the steps are mandatory if the dataset is completelly prepared ---

Explanation of the code:
  - Resize.py
    -- 
    
    
    
  - OneShotAugment.py
    --
    
    
    
---NOTE---

The scripts work for every dataset if :

  - The images are in .png format (otherwise change to your format of preferance)
  - The folders should have a main folder for each category and subfolders for each one of them
      i.e. 
      
          main_dir/Drugs/Opium
          main_dir/Drugs/Cannabis
          main_dir/**/*
